# Python Bank ATM Simulation

This Python script simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using `tkinter`, Python's standard GUI library. It allows users to enter a PIN, check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and exit the ATM session.

## Features

- **PIN Authentication**: Users must enter a correct PIN to access the ATM functionalities.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance in the account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows users to withdraw money, with validation for sufficient balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Enables users to deposit money into their account.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Implemented using `tkinter` for a simple and interactive graphical interface.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
     ```

2. **Usage**
   - Run the script `ATM_machinecode.py`:

     ```bash
     python ATM_machinecode.py
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions:
     - Enter your ATM PIN to access the ATM functionalities.
     - Choose from options to check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, or exit.

3. **Dependencies**
   - The script uses Python's standard library (`tkinter`) for the graphical interface.
